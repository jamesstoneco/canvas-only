Source and examples to accompany my talk, "Canvas Only: Creative Coding with HTML5" at the HTML5 Dev Conf 2013 in SF

## summary ##

Are you interested in creating cool games or interactions for web or mobile? Are you new to graphics programming and want to jump in and experiment. For many years artists and technologists have created amazing installations such as ""Flight Patterns"" by Aaron Koblin by using Processing (both a pre-processed language and api that sits on top of Java). Today the power and simplicity in syntax has been ported to the HTML5 Canvas in Processing.js.

Explore creating 2d and 3d graphics, data visualization, algorithmic art and image generation/alteration. Topics covered include: Processing.js, Paper.js, Three.js and toxiclibs.js. Examples will be shown in Processing, JavaScript and CoffeeScript and benefits and drawbacks of each approach will be given. Creating User Interfaces in the Canvas will be explained as well as strategies for coding for a game style loop.
